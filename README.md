# J-Engine-Dev

This is a repository for my OpenGL 2D (*Technically* 3D) engine written in C++ (C++17)
I'll be working on this from time to time & possibly will be using it to make games, for now it'll only support OpenGL & Windows, but other platforms & render APIs might be added later (though very unlikely).
